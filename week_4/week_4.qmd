## Task Description

In this analysis, we will explore the elasticity of house prices
concerning environmental variables, specifically focusing on the nox
(nitric oxides concentration). We will also examine the effects of an
increasing number of rooms in a house while considering non-constant
effects.

### Objectives

Set up a regression model to answer the following:

1.  **What is the elasticity of price with respect to the level of NOX (pollution in the area)**
2.  **Estimate the effects of adding an 8th room and a 5th room, assuming non-constant effects of the number of rooms.**
3.  **Assess the number of houses in the sample with less than 4 rooms
    and calculate the uncertainty of fit for such observations.**
4.  **Set up a regression another regression model that relaxes the constant elasticity
    assumption.**

## Setup

### Data Preparation

-   Load the HPRICE2 dataset.
-   Inspect the structure of the data to identify necessary variables.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stargazer)

# Load the dataset
data <- readr::read_csv("week_4/data/HPRICE2.csv")

# Inspect the data
head(data)
summary(data)
```
